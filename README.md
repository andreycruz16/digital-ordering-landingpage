# Digital Ordering Landing Page

I built this landing page for a project I started in February 2021. You can re-live the journey through [this Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/zaarheed/status/1361051467659018240).

I have since changed direction with the original project and no longer use this landing page.

Over the months I received an overwhelming amount of positive for what I built. It also converted really well too! Therefore, I decided to opensource for anyone who is looking for inspiration or a helping hand in building their own Digital Ordering project.

### More about the project

The landing page was used for [Buskana](https://www.buskana.com), a project which allowed restaurants, home chefs, foodtrucks and cloud kitchens to take online orders without paying any commission fees. The idea came about after talking to approx. 300 restaurant owners who all complained about the extortionate fees they were paying food delivery apps.

When the COVID-19 lockdown hit London I saw how restaurants were being held hostage by these platforms. So I decided to do something about it. I built a platform that allowed these businesses to take online orders with zero commission fees.

Unfortunately the project didn't work out the way I wanted it to. There were a lot of reasons (read: excuses) I can point to, but competition was the one that slowed me down the most.

There is a lot of competition in this space. And I lost far too many customers to well-funded and established businesses that could offer unsustainable discounts.

As of November 2021, I am still working on Buskana but with a different approach. Feel free to follow along on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/zaarheed).
